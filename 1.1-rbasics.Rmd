# r Basics

```{r}
# find out the working directory
getwd()
# setwd in R

setwd("/Users/drkmenon/")

getwd()

## change back
```



```{r}
setwd("/Users/drkmenon/Sync/books/biometry")
getwd()

# tab key will popout a list of things we may be looking for after entering 
# first 1-2 alphabets

# save this as a project

# myrstats<-save.image("myrstats.rData")

# Essential packages
```



```{r}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(epiR)
library(epiDisplay)
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(randomizeR)

```



```{r}
x<- 2
x
```
x is an object containing variable 2

```{r}
y<-"male"
y
```
 y is an object containing variable "male"
 x is numeric/integer and "male" is factor/character
 factors can be grouped for analysis, characters cannot be
```{r}
class(x)
class(y)
```


 Convert character to factor
```{r}
z= as.factor(y)
class(z)
```
concatenation: it is a string of interconnected things
```{r}
x1<- c(1,2,3,4,5)
x1
```

 different methods of producing concatenated vectors
```{r}
x1<-c(1:5)
x1<-seq(from=1, to=5, by=1)
x1
```
 we can also create repeated sequence in R
```{r}
x2<-rep(1, times=5)
x2

x3<-rep(seq(from=2, to=6, by=0.05), times=5)
x3
```
 extracting elements from concatenated string
```{r}
x1
x1[3]
x1[1:3]
x1[c(2,4)]
x1[-1]
```
 Matrix of elements
 Vector is a list of numbers/characters
 Matrix is an array of numbers/characters in raws and columns
```{r}
m1<-matrix(c(1:20),nrow=5, byrow=T)
m1
```
 similar to vectors, matrix can be subsetted
```{r}
m1[c(2,3), 2]
```
 data_frame is a type of matrix
 we can create data_frame in R or we can import

 Creating data_frame
 first we have to create concatenated strings of variable
name<-c(letters[1:10])
age<-seq(from=63, to=82, by=2)
type_surg<- c(0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0)

# R recognizes this as a number series, we have to covert this to factor
type_surg<-as.factor(type_surg)

pri_event<-c(0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1)
pri_event<-as.factor(pri_event)
time<-c(24,24,24,24,24,3,2,24,24,7)
test_data<- data.frame(name,age,type_surg,pri_event,time)
test_data

# subsetting can be done. important to remember to specify the column as blank 
# after a coma
ageo70<-test_data[age>70,]
ageo70

```
